## Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `./fern.py`

## How it works

The fern is generated by plotting a series of points, beginning with the origin. Each of the following points is calculated by performing 1 of 4 possible linear transformations, with varying probabilities, on the previous point.

### f1: Drawing the stem
This transformation is selected about 1% of the time.

### f2: Drawing successively smaller leaflets
This transformation is selected about 85% of the time.
